The protocol for the production of seed-mediated growth of gold nanorods (of length 20-100nm) was first developed by Jana et. al. The yield they obtained, however, was quite low as their protocol led to the collective synthesis of spherical gold nanoparticles alongwise nanorods. This protocol was refined, and the yield was greatly improved (to ~99%) by El-Sayeed et. al.

In our experiments, we follow their protocol to study the effect of different seeds concentration on the formation of gold nanorods. 

The overall process is two step. The first step is the nucleation of small Au seeds alongside surfactants and surface capping reagents to direct longitudinal growth. This is carried out by preparing a solution of 0.1M CTAB


<!-- The synthesis of Gold Nanorods is an intricate balance between many factors. Obtaining a high yield of monodisperse gold nanorods of a defined aspect ratio requires carefully finetuning various factors such as the concentration of Au seed, growth solution, surfactants, reduction agent, and temperature etc.  -->
