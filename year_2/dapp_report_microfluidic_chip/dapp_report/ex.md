Marginal reduction in material cost.                                                    | Highly versatile. Leaves plenty of room for imaging regardless of needle gauge.                                              | Easy to use. Large margin for potential errors without ruining the sample.                                                                    |
| Double Phase guides                   | Contrives hydrogel to central channel during injection. Allows flow of nutrient media and growth factors  | N/A                                                                    | Shape makes it resistant to bending and tearing, unlike posts. Simplifies extraction of the microchip from mould.        | The hydrophobic nature of the PDMS leads to high contact angles with hydrophilic fluids, essential for fulfilling the Concus–Finn criterion.  | Medium cost. Requires greater precision when making a mould to ensure the correct fluid interactions.  | Low versatility, effectiveness highly dependent on the properties of gel and media. Requires highly viscous gel to be used.  | Difficult to use. Chip must be loaded with gel while upside down. Can be bypassed if not careful; thus secondary (backup) guide is included.  |
