Role of p53 in Ionizing Radiation (IR):
- Role of p53 by being a cell cycle checkpoint determinant
- Wild-type p53 levels are usually low because of short protein half-life (Maki C. G., Howley P. M. Ubiquitination of p53 and p21 is differentially affected by ionizing and UV radiation. Mol. Cell. Biol., 17: 355-363,  1997. Maltzman W., Czyzyk L. UV irradiation stimulates levels of p53 cellular tumor antigen in nontransformed mouse cells. Mol. Cell. Biol., 4: 1689-1694,  1984) 
- p53 increase in response to ionizing radiation and cells undergo a G1 phase cell cycle arrest - done to allow cells to repair DNA before moving on to the S phase to prevent accumulation of mutations.
- p53 also induces apoptosis in certain cell types after irradiation.

Role of p53 in (UV):
- UV radiation -> causes pyrimidine dimer formation - generates photoproducts in DNA -> both of which are repaired through a process called NER. 
- Expression of wild-type p53 was reported to be necessary for efficient NER in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts. (Expression of wild-type p53 is required for efficient global genomic nucleotide excision repair in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts)
- Possibility that p53 can interact directly with XP-B and XP-$ and inhibit their helicase activities in vitro.
- UV can inhibit G1-S phase progression through p53-dependent and independent fashion.


## Paper 2
- Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818803660

Important points:
- NER: Nucleotide Excision Repair (the most common way to repair DNA). Repairs UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-primidone photoproducts - these lesions can pose as structural blockage to transcription and replication and acan result in mutations. 
- In normal human cells, both CPs and 6-4 photoproducts are removed from genomic, non-transcribed DNA thorugh the global genomic NER pathway.

- In normal human fibroblast cells, wt p53 protein levels were induced by approx 10x following UV irradiation. 
- The paper strongly suggests (confirms) that p53 is heavily involved in global NER repair. 


## Paper 3
- Paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400299/
Key findings: 
- Trying to understand the induction pathway of p53 protein. 
- Transcription of the p53 gene and the synthesis of p53 mRNA are low in cells in G_0 and are induced upon induction with mitogens, with a peak in transcription prior to DNA synthesis and maximal mRNA synthesis during mid-S-phase. -> suggests importance of rapid p53-induced arrest in DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage at a time when cells are synthesizing DNA and thus would be most susceptible to DNA damaging events. 
- Suggests two transcription factors RBP-Jk and C/EBP B-2 act as repressor and activator of p53 gene expression, respectively.

## Procedure
To begin culturing the Fibroblast cells, we began by thawing a deep-frozen batch of fibroblasts in a 37 deg C water bath. A prepared fibroblast media (low glucose DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep) was added into the cryovial containing thawed cells to suspend them. This suspension was transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube and spun at 1400 rpm for 4 mins. The supernatant was removed away and the cells were resuspended in 5mL of fresh media and then seeded in a T25 flask, ensuring even distribution. This culture was incubated at 37C / 5% CO2.   

After incubation the cells were passaged. First, the growth media was removed and the flask was washed carefully with warm PBS. Then by incubating with 1xTrypsin at 37C for 5 mins, the cells were detached and collected in a fresh falcon tube and centrifuged to form a pellet. After removing the supernantent, the pellet were resuspended in 5mL of fresh media. Cells were then seeded in a 6-well plate at 6000 cell/cm^2 and incubated again at 37C/5% CO2 for a week.

Following incubation, half the wells (UV group) were subjected to 40 mJ/cm2 of UV-A radiation and then incubated again.

These cells were then used for RNA extraction. Using an RTL buffer, the cell colonies were scraped and stored into different centrifuge tubes for control and UV group. Cells were then lysed using the Qiagen QiaShredder and then the genomic DNA was removed by using the gDNA Eliminator spin column. EtOh was then added to the collection from the gDNA spin column to precipitate RNA. Using multiple rounds of buffer washings in RNeasy spin column, contaminants were eliminated and RNA was finally eluted using RNAse free water.

The extracted RNA was then used to produce cDNA via a Reverse Transcriptase reaction mix (SSIV buffer + DTTs, RNase inhibitor, and Reverse Transcriptase enzyme). The extracted cDNA was then used to perform PCR for the two caretaker genes - COL-1, GAPDH - and three additional genes of interest - TP53, TERT, and MYC. For every gene, three PCR reactions were conducted - Control UV, and Water - accounting for 15 total PCR reactions. The primers used, along with the annealing temperatures are listed in table x.

The PCR products were analyzed by performing Gel Electrophoresis (2g Agarose - in 130mL 1x TAE) for 30 minutes at 180V. 

Parallel to RNA expression analysis, Bisulfite analysis was also performed to evaluate methylation on promoter regions of ELOVL-2 and COL-1 gene. The bisulfite-converted sequences were aligned and analyzed for methylation using CodonCode aligner software.


## Introduction
TP53 (or p53) is one of the most studied genes in human cells. It is tumor suppressor gene, and also acts a transcription factor responsible for activating multiple proteins involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, inducing sensesence, etc. Due to the short half-life of p53, it's concentration in healthy cells is typically low. However, in case of stress, the levels of p53 are elevated in cells, primarily to induce cell cycle arrest and providing time for cells to repair DNA damage if present and induce apoptosis to prevent accumulation of mutations in the cell that might cause cancer downstream. The pathway is explained using a flowchart in figure
